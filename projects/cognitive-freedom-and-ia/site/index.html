    <title>Interactive Report: Cognitive Freedom in the Age of AI</title>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals with Slate Blue/Teal Accents -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a thematic interactive dashboard. This non-linear structure allows users to explore the complex, interconnected topics of the report in a way that suits their interests, rather than following the linear path of the original document. The user flow begins with a high-level introduction, then moves to a central navigation hub that directs them to distinct, interactive sections: 1) Foundational Concepts, 2) AI Impact Analysis, 3) Regulatory Landscape, and 4) Strategies for Autonomy. This structure was chosen because it breaks down dense academic information into manageable, engaging modules, promoting user-driven exploration and better synthesis of the material, which aligns with the report's core theme of autonomy. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: The application translates the report's dense text and tables into interactive components. Report Info: Table 1 (Conceptual Distinctions) -> Goal: Compare/Inform -> Viz: Interactive cards that reveal definitions on click, making learning active. Library: HTML/CSS/JS. Report Info: Table 2 (AI Tech Impacts) -> Goal: Organize/Inform -> Viz: A filterable grid of cards, allowing users to focus on specific technologies and their detailed impacts. Library: HTML/CSS/JS. Report Info: Tables 3 & 4 (Legal Frameworks/Strategies) -> Goal: Compare/Empower -> Viz: A dynamic radar chart that updates based on user selection of a specific threat, visually comparing the effectiveness of different strategic responses (Tech, Edu, Policy). Justification: This is more impactful than a static table and reveals relationships in the data. Library: Chart.js. All visualizations are built on <canvas> with no SVG or Mermaid.js. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->

                    The human mind, historically considered the final sanctuary of personal freedom, now faces an unprecedented challenge. Artificial intelligence is no longer just a tool; it's an environment. AI systems curate our information, guide our choices, and are beginning to interface directly with our neural processes. This report investigates "cognitive freedom"—the right to self-determination over our own thoughts and mental experiences—in this new reality.
                </p>
                <p class="text-slate-600">
                    This interactive application translates the core findings of the report into an explorable format. Navigate through the key concepts, analyze the technologies shaping our cognition, examine global responses, and discover strategies to safeguard our mental sovereignty. Your journey into the future of thought begins here.
